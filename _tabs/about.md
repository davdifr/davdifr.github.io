### Projects

#### On-chain Digital Credentials through NFTs
This project explores the application of blockchain technology to create digital credentials similar to Verified Credentials (VC) or OpenBadges, represented as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). By leveraging NFTs, the project offers a unique, tamper-proof solution for verifying digital identities. This approach presents promising opportunities for enhancing online authentication and ensuring the integrity of digital credentials.

_Technologies used: JavaScript, Solidity._

#### AI-Powered Document Generation
Utilizing artificial intelligence, this solution simplifies the document creation process. Users begin by choosing a template and a knowledge base, which then generates a form for them to complete. The AI uses the provided information to construct specific sections of the document. This method accelerates document creation while maintaining accuracy, consistency, and relevance to the user's requirements.

_Technologies used: Angular, NgRx, OpenAI GPT-4._
